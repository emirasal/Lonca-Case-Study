# Lonca Case Study
 
Project Overview
This Python project reads product data from an XML file, processes it, and inserts the data into a MongoDB database. The project uses an object-oriented approach to represent products and ensures consistent data formatting, such as capitalizing product names and cleaning descriptions of HTML tags.

Files
main.py: The main script that reads the XML, processes the products, and inserts them into MongoDB.
product.py: Contains the Product class, responsible for handling and formatting the product data.
